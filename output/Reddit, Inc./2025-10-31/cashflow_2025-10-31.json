    "cashflow and growth type": {
        "operating cashflow": "Positive \u2014 increased year-over-year. Net cash provided by operating activities rose from $71,622 to $185,159 (three months ended September 30, 2024 vs. three months ended September 30, 2025) and from $132,071 to $424,068 (nine months ended September 30, 2024 vs. nine months ended September 30, 2025). Amounts in the consolidated cash flow tables are stated in thousands.",
        "driver": "The operating cashflow gain was driven by organic business performance and timing, supported by these items quoted from the filing: (1) Higher earnings and revenue: revenue increased to $584,911 (three months ended September 30, 2025) from $348,351 (three months ended September 30, 2024) (amounts in thousands), and net income increased to $162,663 (three months ended September 30, 2025) from $29,853 (three months ended September 30, 2024) (amounts in thousands). (2) Non-cash adjustments: management cites \"adjustments for non-cash items, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense of $258.0 million\" (nine months ended September 30, 2025), which increases reported net income without using cash. (3) Working-capital timing effects: an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $60.9 million (nine months ended September 30, 2025) enhanced cash flow timing, while increases in accounts receivable of $138.8 million (nine months ended September 30, 2025) and prepaid expenses and other assets of $23.4 million (nine months ended September 30, 2025) partially offset cash generation. (4) Not inorganic: investing activity in 2025 shows purchases and maturities of marketable securities that largely offset (\"additional purchases of marketable securities of $1.6 billion, partially offset by maturities and proceeds of $1.6 billion\" for the nine months ended September 30, 2025), and there is no material acquisition cash outlay in 2025 (by contrast, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $17.1 million in 2024). The filing explicitly attributes the operating cash flow increase to higher net income and non-cash adjustments rather than acquisitions, grants, or settlements."

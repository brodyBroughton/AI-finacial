    "company name": "Reddit, Inc.",
    "what_changed_with_debt": "No material funded debt increase \u2014 the company established (but did not draw) a new revolving facility and has minimal outstanding guarantees. Key quoted items (highest to lowest source of debt/obligation): 1) Letters of credit (highest outstanding actual obligation): \"we have issued three letters of credit... for an aggregate of $5.4 million\" (as of September 30, 2025). 2) Revolving Credit Facility commitment (available liquidity, not drawn): \"a five-year, $500.0 million, revolving loan and standby letter of credit facility\" and \"The aggregate available balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $494.6 million as of September 30, 2025.\" (July 1, 2025 amendment; as of September 30, 2025). 3) Funded interest-bearing debt: effectively nil \u2014 evidenced by net interest being income rather than expense: \"Interest (income) expense, net $(22,305) (in thousands)\" for the three months ended September 30, 2025 (i.e., interest income exceeded interest expense). Overall change: no meaningful increase in funded debt for the quarter ended September 30, 2025; only $5.4 million of letters of credit outstanding (noted above).",
    "why_it_changed": "Primary driver: liquidity/flexibility rather than taking on funded debt. The company \"entered into an Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement\" on July 1, 2025 to provide a $500.0 million revolver (quote: \"provides for a five-year, $500.0 million, revolving loan and standby letter of credit facility\"). As of September 30, 2025 the company had only issued letters of credit for an aggregate of $5.4 million and had an \"aggregate available balance under the Revolving Credit Facility... $494.6 million\" \u2014 showing management established the facility for contingencies and working capital optionality rather than to refinance or increase leverage. Supporting reasons include strong operating cash generation and cash balances cited in the filing: \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $424,068 (in thousands)\" for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and \"Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2025.\"",
    "can_they_pay_bills": "Yes \u2014 near-term liquidity appears strong. Evidence and sources: 1) Cash and investments: \"$2.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2025.\" 2) Operating cash flow: \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $185,159 (in thousands) for the three months ended September 30, 2025\" and \"$424,068 (in thousands) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\" 3) Undrawn credit capacity: \"aggregate available balance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $494.6 million as of September 30, 2025.\" 4) Actual near-term funded obligations are small (letters of credit of $5.4 million). The revolver contains customary covenants but the company states it \"was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2025.\" Given positive Free Cash Flow \"$420,526 (in thousands) for the nine months ended September 30, 2025\" and large liquid balance, the company can pay near-term bills without drawing material debt.",
    "management_plan": "Fund needs primarily from operations and existing liquidity, with the revolver as a backstop. Management's stated plan: \"We believe our cash flows from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\" Specific levers: (1) ongoing operating cash generation (Net cash provided by operations $424,068 (in thousands) nine months ended Sept 30, 2025), (2) using $2.2 billion cash and marketable securities on hand (as of Sept 30, 2025), (3) drawing the $500.0 million revolver if needed (available balance $494.6 million as of Sept 30, 2025), and (4) historically available equity financing (IPO proceeds cited historically: \"$600.0 million\" in March 2024) \u2014 but current plan emphasizes operations and the undrawn revolver rather than new funded debt."
